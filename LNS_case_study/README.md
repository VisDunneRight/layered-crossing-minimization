## Supplement to "Fast and readable layered network visualization using large neighborhood search"

Document author: Connor Wilson

In brief, this supplemental material contains:

* A GitHub repository containing all of our code
* Layouts of all control flow graphs in the case study, in SVG and PNG format
* A full version of the paper, including appendices
* A copy of the code used to analyze the results and generate the paper figures
* Some example GIFs showcasing the layout method

### GitHub Code Organization

This repository contains all of our code used for our experiments and case study.
The repo is structured as follows:

* `src` contains the code to generate and optimize models. `optimization.py` contains the ILP model definition and LNS code, and `neighborhood.py` contains the code to find neighborhoods and candidate nodes, for all the techniques in our paper. `tabu.py` contains our implementation of Tabu Search.
* `random graphs` contains all the generated graphs used in our experiments. These were generated by `src/random_graph_generation.py`. *Note: the slim version of this repo excludes this directory as the total file size is large, ~1GB*
* `scripts` contains the shell scripts used to submit jobs for the experiments to the SLURM scheduler
* `control-flow-graphs` contains the decompiled Linux CFGs used in our case study

The root directory contains the files used to run all of our experiments. They are:

* `partition_experiment.py` runs the main experiment of the paper detailed in section 4.2.2
* `binsearch_experiment.py` runs the neighborhood size analysis detailed in section 4.2.1 of the paper
* `limited_mobility_exp.py` runs the restricted movement evalutation detailed in section 4.2.3
* `LNS_case_study.py` runs the case study control flow graph evaluation detailed in section 7

### Guide to Control Flow Layouts

The images are organized as [Format]/[Method]/[Model]/...[CFGname].[Format], where:

* Format is either "svg" or "png"
* Method is "LNS" (our method), "ILP", "Tabu" (Tabu search), or "WM" (weighted median)
* Model is "Crossings" (crossing minimization-only model) or "CR+Bends" (simultaneous crossing and edge length reduction)
* CFGname is the name of the Linux command the control flow graph is decompiled from, e.g., "ls", "head"

### Data Analysis Organization

The following files in this folder may be of greatest interest, the rest are formatted results data:

* `FigureGenerationCode.tar` is a copy of our Observable notebook containing the figure generation code, and contains a readme with instructions for viewing it
* `Analysis code.ipynb` contains our code used to format the raw results data prior to visualizing it.
