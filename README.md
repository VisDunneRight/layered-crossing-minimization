# Quickstart Guide
1. A Gurobi license is recommended to run this app, but not required. Visit [Gurobi for Academics and Researchers](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/) for instructions on obtaining an individual academic license 
   1. The only requirement is to fill out an online form, processing typically takes no more than a few minutes.
2. Install the required packages
3. Run ```main.py``` to optimize an example Rome-Lib graph.

# Overview of class `LayeredOptimizer`
Defined in `src/optimization.py`, `LayeredOptimizer` reads as input a path to graph file or a `LayeredGraph` object.
If you do not have a Gurobi license, the `HiGHSLayeredOptimizer` class defined in `src/optimization_open_src.py` can be used instead.
Besides using a different ILP solver on the back end, it functions identically to `LayeredOptimizer`, with the exception that some switch techniques are not available.

Supported file types for the input graph include `.graphml`, and text files containing an edge list where each line of the file is an edge `u, v` such that `u` and `v` are integer IDs for nodes.
Any path to a Rome-Lib or AT&T graph included in this repo will also be read automatically.

```Python
from src.optimization import LayeredOptimizer
from src.optimization_open_src import HiGHSLayeredOptimizer

optimizer = LayeredOptimizer("[path_to_file]")
optimizer_open_source = HiGHSLayeredOptimizer("[path_to_file]")
```

Then, set the desired options for your `optimizer`:
1. Direct transitivity is the default. To switch to vertical position transitivity, set `optimizer.vertical_transitivity = True` and `optimizer.direct_transitivity = False`.
2. Switches from our paper are set using the following options (note that all switches are off by default):
   1. Symmetry breaking is set using
   ```Python
   optimizer.symmetry_breaking = True
   ```
   2. Butterfly reduction is set using
   ```Python
   optimizer.butterfly_reduction = True
   ```
   3. Polyhedral constraints is set using
   ```Python
   optimizer.polyhedral_constraints = True
   ```
   The 3-claw and dome-path constraints can also be toggled individually by instead using
   ```Python
   optimizer.claw_constraints, optimizer.dome_path_constraints
   ```
   4. Mirrored variables with symmetry constraints is set using
   ```Python
   optimizer.mirror_vars = True
   ```
   5. Cycle constraints is set using 
   ```Python
   optimizer.cycle_constraints = True
   ```
   6. Leaf node collapse is set using 
   ```Python
   optimizer.collapse_leaves = True
   ```
   7. Branching on x-vars is set using 
   ```Python
   optimizer.xvar_branch_priority = True
   ```
   8. Heuristic starting assignments is set using
   ```Python
   optimizer.heuristic_start = True
   ```
   9. Continuous variables is set using 
   ```Python
   optimizer.mip_relax = True
   ```
3. Additional options that may be helpful are:
   1. `optimizer.cutoff_time` sets the amount of time (in seconds) the optimizer will run before terminating and returning its best found solution
   2. `optimizer.draw_graph` generates the image of the layout as an svg in the /Images folder. It is recommended to also set `optimizer.bendiness_reduction` to `True` for a prettier, edge-length minimized drawing.
      1. `optimizer.name` sets the name of the file
   3. `optimizer.verbose` prints more information about the solving process


Finally, optimize the graph using

```Python
optimizer.optimize_layout()
```

## Using predetermined layer assignments
By default, reading a graph by filepath does not read layer information from the file as well (unless the file is one of the provided DAGmar graphs, which are layered).
If the graph you'd like to optimize has predetermined layer assignments, you'll want to load it as a `LayeredGraph` object directly instead of providing a file path directly to the optimizer.
This can be done easily by importing `src/read_data.py` and calling

```Python
from src.read_data import read
g = read("path_to_file", layering=my_layering)
```

where `my_layering` is a Python dictionary mapping node IDs to layer assignments.
`g` can then be passed to a layered optimizer:

```Python
optimizer = LayeredOptimizer(g)
# Set optimization parameters, e.g.
optimizer.symmetry_breaking = True
optimizer.cutoff_time = 60  # Halt solver after 60 seconds
optimizer.optimize_layout()
```

# Other files of note in this repository

1. `src/graph.py` contains our custom layered graph class. A layered graph can be created manually by instantiating the object and using the following functions:
   1. `g.add_node(layer, name=your_custom_name)` adds a node at with layer `layer`. It is recommended to use integers for the names. Integer names 0, 1, 2,... will be used if no name is specified.
   2. `g.add_edge(n1, n2)` adds an edge between nodes with names `n1`, `n2`.
   3. `g.add_anchors()` adds dummy nodes along long edges.
   4. `g.relayer()` is required after inserting dummy nodes. It cleans up the graph by removing empty layers, and optimizing a custom graph may error without it.
   
   The graph data can be accessed as follows:
   1. `g.nodes` is a list of the node objects. A node object `n` has ID `n.name`, layer `n.layer`, within-layer position `n.y` and dummy node identifier `n.is_anchor_node`.
   2. `g.edges` is the edge objects.
   3. `g.node_names` is a dictionary mapping node IDs to node objects.
   4. `g.layers` is a dictionary mapping layer IDs to the list of node objects in that layer.
2. `src/experiments.py` contains functions for all experiments run in our paper. Running this file performs every experiment in our paper (note: this takes an extraordinarily long time to complete, likely close to one month of computation). The methods for running the experiment are detailed at the end of the file.
3. `src/layering.py` contains functions performing the layer assignment step for graphs without predetermined layer assignments, using the algorithms described in our paper.
4. `src/vis.py` contains a function `draw_graph` used to generate images such as the one at the start of this readme. It takes as input a layered graph object and a name for the file.
5. `scripts` contains a number of bash scripts. The ones with "exp" in their name were used to run experiments for our paper on a HPC cluster.
